pl0c
====
`pl0c` is a compiler for the
[PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0)
language. It reads in PL/0 source code and outputs
equivalent C source code.

It was written to be the subject of a series of
[blog posts](https://briancallahan.net/blog/20210814.html)
on writing a compiler from a hands-on practical perspective
for the beginner.

TODO
----
* Implement some sort of basic I/O extension
